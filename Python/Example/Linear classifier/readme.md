In the field of machine learning, the goal of statistical classification is to use an object's characteristics to identify which class (or group) it belongs to. 
A linear classifier achieves this by making a classification decision based on the value of a linear combination of the characteristics. 
An object's characteristics are also known as feature values and are typically presented to the machine in a vector called a feature vector. 
Such classifiers work well for practical problems such as document classification, and more generally for problems with many variables (features), reaching accuracy levels comparable to non-linear classifiers while taking less time to train and use.
