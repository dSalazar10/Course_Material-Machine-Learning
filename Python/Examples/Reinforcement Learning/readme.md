Allows machines and software agents to automatically determine the ideal behavior within a specific context, in order to maximize its performance.

The aim is to assess the goodness of policies and learn from past good action sequences to be able to generate a policy, where the output of the system is a sequence of actions. There is no one best action, just a sequence of correct actions which reach the goal.

An example is game playing. A move is good if it is part of good game policy. A game like chess has a small number of rules but it is very complex because of the large number of possible moves at each state and the large number of moves that a game contains. 

Another example is robot navigation. The robot can move in any number of directions. After a number of trial runs, it should learn the correct sequence of actions to reach to the goal state from an initial state, doing this as quickly as possible and without hitting any of the obstacles.
